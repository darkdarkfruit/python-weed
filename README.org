  """
  Weed-FS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

      to store billions of files!
          to serve the files fast! 

          Instead of supporting full POSIX file system semantics, Weed-FS choose to implement only a key~file mapping. Similar to the word "NoSQL", you can call it as "NoFS". 
  see detail in (https://code.google.com/p/weed-fs/)

  this is a python module for weed-fs.
